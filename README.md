1.1 Frailty study

The given dataset contains information about 10 individuals including their height, weight, age, grip strength, and frailty status. The data is structured as a table with 5 columns and 10 rows. The variables "Height (Inches)", "Weight (Pounds)", "Age", and "Grip strength" are numeric while the "Frailty" variable is categorical with two levels ("Y" and "N").

After the preprocessing steps performed in the R code, the dataset is cleaned and ready for analysis. The missing values are removed using na.omit(). The "Frailty" variable is converted into a binary indicator variable with "Y" coded as 1 and "N" coded as 0. The preprocessed data is then saved to a new CSV file using write.csv().

The preprocessed data is loaded into a new data frame in R called "data2". The summary statistics of the data are checked using summary(). Finally, the required libraries for analysis are loaded in R including ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.

Overall, the dataset is relatively small and can be used to perform various statistical analyses such as correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling to investigate the relationship between the variables and the frailty status of the individuals.



1.2 Performance study

The given dataset contains information about students' performance on their math, reading, and writing tests, as well as demographic and background information, such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The data is structured as a table with 8 columns and an unknown number of rows.

After loading the dataset into R, the first step taken was to remove any missing values using na.omit(). Then, the column names were renamed to make them more readable using colnames(). The white spaces were removed from the columns using trimws(). The "Race_Ethnicity" column was converted to a factor variable using as.factor(). Finally, the clean data was saved to a new CSV file using write.csv().

Next, the necessary libraries for data visualization were loaded, including ggplot2. The preprocessed data was loaded into a new data frame in R called "student_data". The head of the data frame was checked using head(). Then, several data visualizations were created using ggplot(), including a scatterplot of math score vs. reading score by gender, a boxplot of math score by race/ethnicity, a bar chart of test preparation course by parental level of education, a density plot of writing scores by gender, and a bar chart of lunch by race/ethnicity. These plots were saved to files using ggsave().

Overall, the dataset provides valuable information on students' performance on standardized tests and their demographic and background information. The preprocessing steps performed in the R code make the dataset ready for further analysis and visualization.
